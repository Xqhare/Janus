# Janus
Janus is a file transformation service. It's named after the roman god Janus, the god of beginnigns, transitions, passages, frames and endings. Also the month of January is named after him.

Janus delivers a modern, sleek, performant, lean, mean, minimalist, feature rich, high-tech, no-nonsense, no-compromise, vision or data driven, robust and most importantly BLAZINGLY FAST service; it's written in rust after all.
